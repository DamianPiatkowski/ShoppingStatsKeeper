A Python CLI program that collects statistics on the user's shopping spending and stores them in a json file. 

Each month it summarizes the stats and sends an email report message. It does comparisions with the last 3 months' average values if there is enough data in the json.

There is some customization when the program is run the first time. It asks:
- whether the user is vegetarian
- what their maximum spending in a month goal is (and later uses it in the report message)
- what the user's currency is
